# TheSource Rewards App

> An App created during the 2019 Bell IT Business Case Challenge.

## Rewards App Overview

For the technical aspects, we decided to develop an intuitive mobile rewards app as part of a loyalty program in which customers can gain & keep track of their points, view 
past transactions/rewards history, and view their user profile. Secure user authentication using email and Google accounts is done
using Firebase Authentication as well as Firebase database for real-time data storage/retrieval.
In addition, we integrated Google DialogFlow for the creation of a Support Chatbot in which customers can have answers to commonly
asked questions easily using Googles natural language processing and machine learning capabalities.

## POS App Overview

A native Android App to function as a POS terminal in which employees can deduct and add points to customers accounts.
Works simply by entering the points amount to add/deduct and then scan the customers unique QR code to transfer over the points.
