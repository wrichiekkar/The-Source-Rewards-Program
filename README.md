## Challenges:
1. Low frequency of customer purchase
2. Low conversion rate (customers visit in-store to making a purchase online)
3. Customer reach (stores in low traffic areas, dealer stores)

## Summary

Consumer electronics is a multi-billion dollar market which is changing everyday. As the ecommerce space has been booming the past
couple of years, Amazon has taken the lead in offering consumer products right to the door step. However, physical
stores are still popular as many consumers rather see and try out a product in-store before making the purchase. As the world
becomes more digitally connected through smartphones and various gadgets, this creates space for innovative ways to connect
consumers to visit stores and increase customer frequency and purchases.

Our task was to find a way to increase customer facing by encouraging customers to frequently visit stores
as well as increase the customer retention rate.

## Solution
To tackle this challenge, we decided to implement a loyalty program. Customers can scan a barcode on a rewards card or through a mobile app to collect points that they can later redeem in-store for merchandise or cash value on their next purchase. This will drive customers to frequently visit stores and collect points, increasing customer frequency. Moreover, this will also develop a better relationship between the employee and the customer leading them to further visit their local store.

Our loyalty program focused on incentivizing the 2nd purchase. 


**Our solution includes:**

1. Analysis
2. Recommendations
3. Implementation (Loyalty Card, Website, App, Marketing)
4. Architecture 
5. Risk Mitigation
