## The Source Rewards Website

> An Website created during the 2019 Bell IT Business Case Challenge.

## Overview

The website was designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. The initial page, index.html was created to act as a sales page to pitch the idea to The Souce customers.

In the navigation bar, the my account section was created to show an authenticated vs non-authentiacated view. On this page you can sign up, or login to TheSource rewards program. The login was created using a real-time database (google firebase). Once you enter an email and password, it sends a request to the database verifying the credentials, any errors are displayed to the user. Upon successful authentication, the page becomes a Member page (authenticated view). On this page you can see a demo as to what a potential authenticated user can see.
